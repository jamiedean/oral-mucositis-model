# Severe acute oral mucositis normal tissue complication probability model

Random forest classification model of severe acute oral mucositis resulting from head and neck radiotherapy.

To run the model use the PredictMucositisNtcp.py Python script (Python version 2 should be installed). The Model folder and inputData.csv file should be in the working directory. Values for the model covariates should be entered into the inputData.csv file.

Details on model training and validation can be found in the article:

Normal tissue complication probability (NTCP) modelling using spatial dose metrics and machine learning methods for severe acute oral mucoositis resulting from head and neck radiotherapy. Dean  JA et al. Radiother Oncol 2016.

Please cite the above article in publications using the model.

This model is intended for research purposes only. It has not yet been externally validated and so should not be employed to make individual patient management decisions.
